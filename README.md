# Credit_Risk_Classification

Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


## Technologies

This project leverages python3 with the following packages:

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/) - For arrays and math.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - For organizing data and creating DataFrames.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For dataframs and csv reading.

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - For machine learning applications. 

* [holowviews](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/) - To plot data. 

* [imblearn](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) - For imbalanced classes.
